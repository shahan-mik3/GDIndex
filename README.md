# GDIndex

Forked from [maple3142/GDIndex](https://github.com/maple3142/GDIndex)

Modified for my usage - trimmed down to only support lite mode with a slightly different UI

Everything is configurable using environment variables (mostly -- need to figure out how to deal with the namespaces too)

|Configuration|Environment Varible Name|
|---|---|
|Page title|`TITLE`|
|Default root folder id |`DEFAULT_ROOT_ID`|
|Client id |`CLIENT_ID`|
|Client secret|`CLIENT_SECRET`|
|Refresh token|`REFRESH_TOKEN`|
|Folder title|`FOLDER_TITLE`|

If you're using a service account, drop `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN`.

Instead set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to `true`, and set `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (should be self-explanatory)

There may be issues (remove all newlines [and maybe spaces between keys] from the SA json before pasting it in, wrangler-action seems to fail often otherwise)

If you're manually deploying, then `wrangler kv:key put --binding sa SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON "$(cat sa.json)"`is enough, no need to edit the JSON

(Folder title is what is prefixed to the folder name on its page)

If not using a service account, do set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT to false

You can set the the above as well as `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CF_API_TOKEN` as secrets in the github repository, for auto deploying on a push to the repo. You will require  `CF_ZONE_ID` (and make [this](https://github.com/AOSiP/aosip-downloads/commit/731be66feb39a4482da32f0b5292d32f13b7f8a9) change to the workflow) as well if you're deploying to your own domain and not a workers.dev domain, which will also require you to set `workers_dev` to `false` in `wrangler.toml`, and set `route` to your domain.


(Go set the encrypted secrets manually once, since the wrangler action first tries to publish the worker and then set the secrets, and the worker can't be published before the secrets exist)

You can create a random worker and set those names as random values, or you can `echo value | wrangler secret put key` after creating a dummy worker

Create a namespace named `sa` with `wrangler kv:namespace create sa` and update the `wrangler.toml` based on the output it gives you
